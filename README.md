## Acknowledgments
* Thanks to GWG for the starter code for this project
* This code is essentially from a [GWG webinar](https://zoom.us/recording/play/aulotDlzKFegQFIJTaTzKgWvNkVsYtlwO454vL1UPE1Cm6lOUBQCtfVurPOIAGAS?startTime=1529542978000) on this project.  I absolutely could not figure it out or understand how this game works. This project is terrible for learning to work with objects and classes.  There is too much going on with this project to effectively learn anything, at least it is for me.
